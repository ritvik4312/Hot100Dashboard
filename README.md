## Billboard Hot 100 Dashboard  

An interactive data visualization app built with **Plotly Dash** to explore Billboard Hot 100 trends. The project:  

- Cleans and standardizes raw CSV inputs for accurate analysis.  
- Provides dynamic interactivity with dropdowns, sliders, and callbacks to filter by artist, year, and chart position.  
- Uses **Pandas** for aggregations such as peak positions, weeks on chart, seasonal entry patterns, and artist rankings.  
- Visualizes insights with bar, line, and pie charts, including top artists, one-hit vs. multi-hit distributions, and yearly #1 song counts.
